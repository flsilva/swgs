# svgs

![](logo.png)

The `svgs` module is compatibility layer between `react-native-svg` and regular
`react` (browser) based SVG elements. This allows you to write SVG in the react
and react-native using exactly the same API. Bringing your applications a step
closer to writing fully isomorphic application.

The library itself is written in ES6 and comes with the correct babel
transforms as dependencies so it's easy to integrate in your existing tool
chains and webpack builds.

## Install

For regular react usage:

```
npm install --save svgs
```

For React-Native usage:

```
npm install --save svgs
npm install --save react-native-svg
react-native link react-native-svg
```

Word of caution, make sure that you install a `react-native-svg` version that
works with your `react-native` version.

## API

The API that we expose is exactly the same as the `react-native-svg` project so
please visit: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg for the
full API documentation. But here is a quick little overview of the available
elements:

```js
import Svg, {
  Circle,
  ClipPath,
  Defs,
  Ellipse,
  G,
  Image,
  Line,
  LinearGradient,
  Path,
  Polygon,
  Polyline,
  RadialGradient,
  Rect,
  Stop,
  Symbol,
  Text,
  TextPath,
  Use
} from 'svgs';
```

Any incompatibilities should be seen as a bug and be reported in the
[svgs/issue](https://github.com/godaddy/svgs/issues) page on Github.

#### Example

Import all the SVG elements and make a Twitter logo.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Svg, { Path } from 'svgs';

class Twitter extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Svg height='1208' width='1000' viewbox='0 0 1000 1208.3' preserveAspectRatio='meet'>
        <Path fill='#000' d='M0 1007.9q139.6 92.1 305.8 92.1 76.7 0 146.9-18.1 70.2-18.1 126.5-50 56.2-31.9 103.9-75.6 47.7-43.8 82.5-95.7 34.8-51.8 59.2-108.9 24.4-57.1 36.5-116.3 12-59.1 12-117.5 0-17.9-0.4-26.6 13.4-10 42.1-25.5 28.8-15.4 51-30.8 22.3-15.4 34-33.3-15.8 7.1-41.5 10-25.6 2.9-56.4 3.7-30.8 0.9-44.2 2.5 34.6-21.6 69.2-58.1 34.6-36.5 45-69.8-31.3 19.2-76.3 38.3-45 19.2-77 25.9-28-30.4-65.7-47.5-37.7-17.1-79.8-17.1-54.1 0-100.2 27.5-46 27.5-72.7 74.6-26.6 47.1-26.6 102.5 0 24.1 5 46.6-122.5-6.6-229.4-63.1-106.9-56.4-181.9-150.6-26.7 46.7-26.7 102.9 0 52.1 23.8 97.1 23.7 45 64.6 72.9-48.4-1.2-90-25.4l0 2.5q0 73.7 45.4 130.2 45.4 56.5 114.6 70.2-25 7.5-52.5 7.5-19.2 0-37.9-3.7 19.1 61.6 70.4 101.2 51.2 39.6 116.2 40.8-108.7 87.5-247.9 87.5-25.8 0-47.5-2.9z' />
      </Svg>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Accessibility

If you want Section 508 Accessibility add the `title` prop to the `<Svg />` component like this:
```js
<Svg title="Image Description" width="1000" height="1000" ... />
```
When this renders on native, you'll get your SVG wrapped in a View with an accessibilityLabel.
On web, the SVG element will get two aria labels and a `<title>` element that are
required for accessibility.
```html
<svg role="img" aria-label="[title]" width="1000" height="1000">
  <title>Image Description</title>
  ...
</svg>
```
